# Capstone-Project
Repo containing code for Lucas Mantovani's Meta University capstone project.

#### User Roles

- Advertiser: a company who wants to display their products on Meta's platforms
- Ads management organizations: companies paid by the advertiser to manage their ads on Meta's platforms. These companies have access to 
the advertiser's platform on Meta's ads interface.

####  User Personas

- Advertiser: Ad-intensive companies such as Adidas, The Wall Street Journal, basketball teams, and others. These organizations post a lot
of targeted ads on Meta's platforms and often have partner companies managing their ads through the interface created by the SPEX team.
To help them sort out the different partner companies which have access to their ads interface, it would be useful to have a favoriting feature on the
ads interface such that they could pick the ones which closely manage their ads. 

- Ads management organizations: Through the favoriting feature, these companies will be contacted by the advertisers they are collaborating with 
more quickly, since they will show up at the top of the advertiser's ads management page. This will speed up communications between both parties. 

####  User Stories

- "Nike is a multinational sports clothing company. Because they run many ads on Meta's family of apps that are often managed by third-parties, 
they currently need to spend many minutes sorting out which of these companies to contact through their ads managing platform."

- "AlphaAds is an ads management company which often collaborate with multinationals like Adidas and CNN. Because the current Meta ads interface 
has no sorting system for partner advertising companies, AlphaAds employees often need to wait long to be notified about any changes to current ads campaigns, leading to delayed responses concerning their client's campaings. For example, they are only notified that Adidas stopped targeting 20 year-old
college students in Germany on a sneaker campaign twenty minutes after the fact because Meta currently offers no sorting mechanism of partner companies on its ads management platform."
